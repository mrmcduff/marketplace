# marketplace
A marketplace simulator in Node.

## Description
This project aims to simulate and provide a framework for an engine for a market-and-trade style simulator that can be attached to any kind of front end.

## How to run
For now, proof of concept in all classes is achieved by running the included jest tests. Planned future work will allow for command-line based I/O, and eventually an Express-based http version to do more interesting transactions.
